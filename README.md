# SMU TA System

*Project By Kyle Booth, Kate Bouis, JP Heck, and Eric Houtman*

### Introduction
This repo is for a software development project created using the Play framework. The project is for a TA Application system, which is a website that both TAs and professors at a university can register for. Professor accounts have permissions to create TA job openings and hire TAs that fit their requirements. TA accounts see these postings and apply to jobs that fit their schedule and experience. 

### Purpose
This project has two purposes. The first is to learn how to properly go through the software engineering process, from documentation from implementation. This project is for CS 4345 at SMU, which is Software Engineering Principles, and is therefore designed to teach proper software engineering methods.

The second purpose is to bring TAs and professors at SMU together to efficacize and decentralize the hiring process. This application has the potential for real world deployment on the university scale, and the implementation of this application into the SMU system would be useful to staff and TAs alike.
